#summary Building from Source

Use this command to anonymously check out the latest project source code:
{{{
svn checkout http://gtkjfilechooser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gtkjfilechooser-read-only
}}}

Run the follow ant target to create a distributable zip with a demo:
{{{

}}}

If you only the the jar, this ant command is enough:
{{{

}}}

Note that the source is an eclipse project ready as it is to be imported in any workspace without any external dependency.
